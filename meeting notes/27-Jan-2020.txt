dont use the word 'novel'

good i mpact to measure , setu p code to ultimate query to , some evaluations
need to have sort of measurement infrastructure.

don't know if it is practical. should spent some time to figure it out.
SOoner we figure out there s a root cause to this, need to be sure this is the exact problem, 
or there might be lot of performance problem throughout the application


interpreting gantt chart of time series of things, low level view - only draw few rectangles,
high level view - don't have to query all rectangles.

covnert the gantt view to time series

===============================================================
Next week 
brief on the existing implementation, when it says draw this part, what frontend do and what backend do and how they are affected with one another.



measure the 
not use the word exponentially. 
3rd number modify it.

logn time worth being recalculating 

baseline (data loading had to 

Midterm milestone - measure everything thats there, 
1April - Have a understanding of making the current system slower
understanding the performance profileing for frontend and also the backend 

instrument the frontend 


1. go thorugh beginiing to end , look at the profiler form web browser and backend and runtime analysis on python
2. 

fenwick tree - operations must be commutative and associative 


1. understand what to measure
2. query to solving the problem
3. document


Next week task
-----------------------------------------
--------- Read the paper, Carlos will send it
Demonstration of the project, what frontend does, what backend does, 
In writing, write a docuemnt and upload it on github adn link it on the source-code, 
Create a .md file in github and share it with Carlos. and write the report. 

<<<< Next thing >>>>>>
measure things
- Chrome profiler
- timestamping within python code
