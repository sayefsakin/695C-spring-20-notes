might have to take the min/median instead of avg (store these numbers seperately, find the perfromance at some percentile value)


haven't done
- implement in c
- trash interpreter (like useing seperate vector with left and right value of binary search) (vectorize things)
- minimize the total number of calls to c functions (can calculate one time for the search)


visualize just the utilizzation thing (without the gantcharts stuffs)


gerbage collector between c or python 
we want all of these things in python and leave the computer to c 
making a call to the memory allocation - is slow 

could utlize a 3 contigeous arrays (ding **** ).

look for library that allow to do the integration (python library : ctype, cmake or something like it --- google it)
do dynamic allocaiton, assign in python and can be found in c
(python cffi, swigg (software interface generator), 

CFFI ython lib dot so file look into google


=======left these for later=========
boost library in c++,
boost.python
